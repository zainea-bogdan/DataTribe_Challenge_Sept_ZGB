# DataTribe_Challenge_Sept_2025_ZGB

## General Context of this report

This project was created as part of the **RomanianDATA Tribe Challenge**, from September 2025. 

The main theme was : *highlight county-level patterns in packaging returned per capita across Romania*.

## Project Overview

My main idea was to go in another direction from the original report and explore **how counties compare with their neighbors**, in order to see how close, or how far apart, they really are.  

An educational example:

Key insights from my home county, **Ialomița**:
- The gap with **Sibiu** is minimal — just a few cans per person.  
- Differences with **Prahova** and **Dolj** are more visible, around 120 grams per person.
- Overall, **Ialomița ranks close to the Top 10**, showing strong participation in the deposit return system.

## Technical Details

This was also my first deeper dive into **Power BI** for storytelling with data.  

- Built a few simple **custom DAX metrics**.  
- Designed in both **light and dark themes** to explore how readability changes with style.  
- Includes an **interactive map** where values from the other cards update dynamically as you explore different counties.  


These design choices showed me how much **presentation impacts the story** behind the numbers (And also how much Power Bi has to offer as a visualization tool).
